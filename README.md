The program first prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.

It then uses a switch statement to perform the operation based on the operator (+, -, *, /).

For division, it checks if the second number is zero to avoid division errors.

Finally, it outputs the result or an error message if an invalid operator or division by zero is attempted.
